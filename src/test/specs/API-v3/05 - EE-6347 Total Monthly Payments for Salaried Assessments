Feature: Category A & B Financial Requirement - Solo & Combined Applications for Salaried Assessments

    # JIRA STORIES: EE-6347 (Total Monthly Payments for Salaried Assessments)
    # Scenarios where Categories A & B Salaried Assessments pass
    # Multiple payments within the same month can be added together and used before the comparison against the annual check takes place
    # Employment check threshold is £1550 within the immediate 32 days from and inclusive of application raised date
    # Annual threshold is £18,600 if no dependents are included. Addition of a first dependent child adds £3,800 then each thereafter a further £2,400.
    # Formula for calculating Category A & B Salaried income for comparison against the threshold is:
    #       - Total of all payments within each consecutive month within the 6-month (CAT A) or 12-month (CAT B) range
    # If the assessment is being made against salaried employment then the following applies:
    #       - Monthly payments alone – Achieved by meeting a minimum consistent value of £1,550 per month
    #       - Weekly payments alone – Achieved by meeting a minimum consistent value of £358.00 per week
    #       - Fortnightly payments alone – Achieved by meeting a minimum consistent value of £715.00 per fortnight
    #       - 4-Weekly payments alone– Achieved by meeting a minimum consistent value of £1430 per 4-weekly
    #       - Mixture of any of the above

    Scenario: Category A. No dependents. Annual Check Met. Multiple payments in the month at the start of the assessment range.
